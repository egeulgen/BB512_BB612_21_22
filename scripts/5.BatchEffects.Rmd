# Data

The analyses are based on gene expression data from a bladder cancer study: [Gene expression in the urinary bladder: a common carcinoma in situ gene expression signature exists disregarding histopathological classification](http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/64/11/4040.full.pdf). The data can be loaded from the bladderbatch data package.

```{r data}
data(bladderdata)

pheno <- pData(bladderEset)
edata <- exprs(bladderEset)
```

```{r p_eda}
head(pheno)

table(pheno$outcome)
table(pheno$cancer)
table(pheno$batch)
```

# Visualizing by batch

```{r}
pr_res <- prcomp(t(edata))

plot(pr_res$x[, 1], pr_res$x[, 2], col = pheno$batch, pch = as.numeric(pheno$cancer),
     xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
```

# Adjusting for batch effects with a linear model

```{r}
mod <- model.matrix(~as.factor(cancer) + as.factor(batch), data=pheno)
fit <- lm.fit(mod, t(edata))
hist(fit$coefficients[2, ], col = 2, breaks = 100)
```

This will only work if the batch effects aren’t too highly correlated with the outcome:

```{r}
table(pheno$cancer, pheno$batch)
```

# Adjusting for batch effects with Combat

Another approach is to use Combat. Combat returns a "cleaned" data matrix after batch effects have been removed. Here we pass a model matrix with any known adjustment variables and a second parameter that is the batch variable.

```{r}
batch <- pheno$batch
modcombat <- model.matrix(~1, data=pheno)
modcancer <- model.matrix(~cancer, data=pheno)
combat_edata <- ComBat(dat = edata, batch = batch, mod = modcombat, par.prior = TRUE, prior.plots = FALSE)
combat_fit <- lm.fit(modcancer, t(combat_edata))
hist(combat_fit$coefficients[2,], col = 2, breaks = 100)
```

# Comparing Combat and linear adjustment

We can compare the estimated coefficients from Combat and linear adjustment by looking at the right coefficients for each model:

```{r compare}
plot(fit$coefficients[2, ], combat_fit$coefficients[2, ], col = 2,
      xlab = "Linear Model", ylab = "Combat", xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(-5, 5))
abline(c(0, 1), col = 3, lwd = 3)
```

# Adjusting for batch effects with `sva`

First we need to estimate the surrogate variables. To do this, we need to build a model with any known adjustment variables and the variable we care about `mod` and another model with only the adjustment variables `mod0`. Here, we won’t adjust for anything to see if `sva` can "discover" the batch effect.

```{r sva}
mod <- model.matrix(~cancer, data = pheno)
mod0 <- model.matrix(~1, data = pheno)
sva1 <- sva(edata, mod, mod0, n.sv=2)
```

See if any of the variables correlate with batch:

```{r assoc_sva_combat}
summary(lm(sva1$sv ~ pheno$batch))

boxplot(sva1$sv[,2] ~ pheno$batch)
points(sva1$sv[,2] ~ jitter(as.numeric(pheno$batch)),col=as.numeric(pheno$batch))
```

Add the surrogate variables to the model matrix and perform the model fit:

```{r}
modsv <- cbind(mod,sva1$sv)
fitsv <- lm.fit(modsv, t(edata))
```

Compare the fit from surrogate variable analysis to the other two:

```{r compare2}
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
plot(fitsv$coefficients[2, ], combat_fit$coefficients[2, ], col = 2,
      xlab = "SVA", ylab = "Combat", xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(-5, 5))
abline(c(0, 1), col = 3, lwd = 3)
plot(fitsv$coefficients[2, ], fit$coefficients[2, ], col = 2,
      xlab="SVA", ylab="linear model", xlim = c(-5, 5),ylim = c(-5, 5))
abline(c(0, 1), col = 3, lwd = 3)
par(mfrow=c(1, 1))
```
